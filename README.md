A File Q&A ChatBot using OpenAI API allows users to upload text articles and ask questions about the content of these articles. It uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate answers, providing an interactive way to explore information within documents.

Features:
- Upload text or markdown files and ask the app to answer questions based on the content.
- Secure input for OpenAI API keys with a sidebar widget.
- Interactive questioning with enabled/disabled state based on file upload status.

This prototype was done from a workshop from herHACK Switzerland.
